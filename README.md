## Project 3: Pizza bot
This is a pizzabot project that was done in a remote pair-programming setup. 
It asks you some pizza order related questions and gives feedback with cooking time calculated and the price.

## Focus
* JavaScript functions, 
* Hook the JavaScript parts up with the HTML 
* Pair-programming

## The process

* We decided on how the app should look like and the structure of it.
* We put together the JavaScript logic with functions using alert.
* We connected tht JavaScript to HTML to visualize the process of ordering a pizza.

## Challenges to solve
Add some pizza images when a user has to choose one from the menu.
